# Lonely Integer

This challenge involves finding the unique element in an array of integers where all other elements occur twice.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

**Example:**

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The unique element is `4`.

**Function Description:**

Complete the `getLonelyInteger` function to return the lonely integer.

**Input Format:**

The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.
The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that describe the values in `a`.

**Constraints:**

* It is guaranteed that `n` is an odd number and that there is one unique element.
* 0 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, where 0 ≤ `i` < `n`.
